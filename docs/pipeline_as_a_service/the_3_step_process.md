# Composing your CI/CD pipeline
The Pipeline as a Service will guide you through a 3-step process that will
allow you to customize ready-to-be used CI/CD pipelines.

:::note Naming your pipeline
As an initial requirement, the web will ask you to provide a name for the
pipeline. It is mainly required for the internal operation of the SQAaaS (e.g
to create the associated code repository, to be used as the job name in the CI
system), so it is not crucial for the pipeline itself, but it is highly
recommended to provide a meaningful name.
