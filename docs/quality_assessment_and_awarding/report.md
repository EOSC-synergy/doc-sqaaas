title: Analysing the results
---

The results obtained by the QAA module highlight the achievements that
characterize a given code repository, and point developers or code owners to
those specific parts where quality can be improved. Thus, the ultimate goal is
to increase the overall quality of the code so that the software product takes
credit.

The results view shows a report detailing the validity of the criteria covered
during the assessment. This validity is estimated on the basis of the results
and criticality provided by the individual subcriteria. This means that only
the subcriteria with the highest level of criticality is considered for the
criterion's overall success.

:::note

As stated throughout the docs, the current implementation is aligned with the
[A set of Common Software Quality Assurance Baseline Criteria for Research
Projects](https://indigo-dc.github.io/sqa-baseline/) document, and thus, the
codes that identify the subcriteria are defined here.

### Awarding (aka Badges)

Reporting is complemented with awarding when the software being analysed
reaches a minimum level of quality. This is based on the fact that, similarly
to the subcriteria covered above, not all the criteria have the same level of
importance. We have previously established those levels in the
[Badging in EOSC-Synergy](synergy_badging_approach.md).
