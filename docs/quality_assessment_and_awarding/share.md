title: Sharing the badges
---

The digital badges obtained when assessing digital assets with SQAaaS can be
shared in popular code and data repository platforms. Here we offer two ways of
doing so, either by using a custom entry that uses the EOSC-Synergy badge image
or through the [shields.io](https://shields.io/) common badge solution.

The specific code in Markdown is available for each
of the options, so that when the badge is clicked, you will be redirected to a
[Badgr](https://info.badgr.com/) page with all the information about the
quality attributes of the badge.

:::note
The only piece of information you need to change in the following examples is
the URL that corresponds to your badge, which is provided as a result of the
SQAaaS assessment process. The one used for the examples below is
https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/bw3v-fVCR6eJoMjwG11afw

### EOSC-Synergy badge image

In this case, we will use a 150x116 pixel sized image so that it does not take
much space in your README. The proposed solution would render as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/badge_share_image.png"/>
</p>

The following sections provide examples for displaying the different classes of
EOSC-Synergy badges.
