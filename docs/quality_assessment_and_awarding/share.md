title: Sharing the badges
---

The digital badges obtained when assessing digital assets with SQAaaS can be
shared in popular code and data repository platforms. Here we offer two ways of
doing so, either by using a custom entry that uses the EOSC-Synergy badge image
or through the [shields.io][https://shields.io/] common badge solution. 

The specific code in Markdown, ready to be copy-pasted, is available for each
of the options, so that when the badge is clicked, you will be redirected to a
[Badgr](https://info.badgr.com/) page with all the information about the
quality attributes of the badge. Besides, you will be able to perform
additional operations such as verifying the badges.

### EOSC-Synergy badge image

In this case, we will use a 150x116 pixel sized image so that it does not take
much space in your README. The proposed solution would be:

```markdown
#### Achievements 
[![SQAaaS badge](https://github.com/EOSC-synergy/SQAaaS/raw/master/badges/badges_150x116/badge_software_bronze.png)](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/bw3v-fVCR6eJoMjwG11afw "SQAaaS bronze badge achieved")
```

which would be rendered as:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/badge_share_image.png"/>
</p>

### shields.io badge

The popular [shields.io][https://shields.io/] can be also be used to share a
SQAaaS badge:

```markdown
[![SQAaaS badge shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqaaas%20software-bronze-e6ae77)](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/bw3v-fVCR6eJoMjwG11afw "SQAaaS bronze badge achieved")
```

which would be rendered as:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/badge_share_shields.png"/>
</p>
